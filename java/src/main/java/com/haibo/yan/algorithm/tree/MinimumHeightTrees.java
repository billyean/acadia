 *
 * For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a
 * rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 * Given such a graph, write a function to findInTwo all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.
 *
 * Format
 * The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected
 * edges (each edge is a pair of labels).
 * You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as
 * [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
 * Example 1:
 * Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
 *
 *    0
 *    |
 *    1
 *   / \
 *  2   3
 *
 * return [1]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Given n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]
 *   0  1  2
 *    \ | /
 *      3
 *      |
 *      4
 *      |
 *      5
 *   return [3, 4]
 *
 *   Note:
 *   (1) According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: â€œa tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are
 *   connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree. "
 *   (2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
